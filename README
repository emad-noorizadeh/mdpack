mdpack (Molecular Dynamics Package) 
version 0.1  
-------------

mdpack aimed at research scientists and algorithm developers 
for bio molecular simulation. The goal is to provide developers with
collections of libraries and methods, so that they can test their
methods by using the mdpack library and its utilities.

Required coordinates, structure and parameters files are:
Structure file : mdpack uses NAMD psf file (which can be generated by stand alone psfgen application)
Coordinates file: mdpack uses NAMD pdb file (which can be generated by stand alone psfgen application)
Note that both psf and pdb can be generated using psfgen from an original pdb (protein data bank file)
Parameters file: mdpack can read current version of charmm22, charm27, and charmm36

Force field: It uses charmm but without the recent addition of cross terms for dihedrals

Constant energy: mdpack uses verlet algorithm for constant energy simulation
Constant temperature: mdpack offers, two version of Langevin, langevin and langevin1, and Nose-Hoover-Langevin

Output: mdpack provide standard output similar to NAMD format, for trajectories mdpack offer xyz format in both
binary and non-binary format.


The codes have been successfully tested on Linux. Compiling the software requires the 
GNU version of make. To compile change to src directory and then type make and then make install:

$ cd src           # assuming you are in mdpack directory
$ make
$ make install             


Example: There is an example of alanin dipeptide in examples/alanine
To compile the example change directory to examples/alanine and type
$ make
To run, type
$ time ./adp nSteps  # where nSteps is the number of step you want to run the simulation for

Note: You can use adp.config to change the parameters of simulation for alanine
